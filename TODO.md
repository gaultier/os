- [x] Embed kernel.exe in boot.bin somehow (at build time)
- [ ] Copy in bootloader kernel.exe to the right location in memory (at run time)
- [ ] Jump at the end of bootloader to `kmain` (parse entrypoint in ELF or the code is in raw binary format)
- [ ] Read from kmain the memory mapping information (maybe?)
